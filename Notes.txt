An end-to-end encrypted chat application that uses public key encryption and a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture in Python is quite a comprehensive app. each part.



python e2e_aio.py

Menu:
1. Receive Messages Or File
2. Send A New Message
3. Send An Encrypted File
4. Toggle Logging
5. Generate A New Key-Pair
6. Load Remote Public Key
7. Set Alias / Username
8. Exit




Steps:

1 generate your public key pair and share only your public key and get a copy of your peers public key (you basically are swapping public keys)!

2 set your alias (username / codename)

3 update your remote peers key

now choose to recieve or write a message from menu to use!

can now send and recieve encypted files!

Please Note:
make sure the port your trying to use is open and forwarded to correct ip in your router!

Some settings are required like keys for example and some settings have defaults! 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:
Each user will act as both a client and a server, allowing them to connect directly to each other without needing a central server.
You can use Python libraries like socket or asyncio for networking and threading for handling multiple peers.

2. Public/Private Key Encryption:
Use RSA (or Elliptic Curve Cryptography for better performance).
Python's cryptography or PyCryptodome library can be used for encryption.
Each user will generate a public/private key pair and exchange public keys with their contacts.

3. Message Encryption and Decryption:
When sending a message, it will be encrypted using the recipient's public key.
The recipient will decrypt the message using their private key.
You can also use hybrid encryption: encrypt the message with a symmetric key (e.g., AES), and encrypt the symmetric key with the recipient's public key.

4. Decentralization:
For decentralization, a distributed hash table (DHT) could be used for peer discovery, or you could hard-code the IP addresses of peers.
Tools like libp2p (for building peer-to-peer networks) could be considered for more advanced use.

This is a simple end-to-end encrypted, decentralized P2P chat in Python. To build a full application, you'll need:

UI: Use frameworks like Tkinter or Kivy for a GUI.
Security: Consider further encryption (e.g., hybrid encryption with AES).
Network Discovery: Implement a more robust P2P discovery mechanism like DHT.
Reliability: Handle reconnections, message acknowledgments, and persistence.
If you're going for full decentralization, using existing P2P libraries (such as libp2p in Python or even IPFS) will greatly simplify some of the more complex parts of the network.
